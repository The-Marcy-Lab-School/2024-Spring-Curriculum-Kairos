## Part 0 - Grid + Media Queries Demo!

> **Pacing**: 10 minutes (10 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** See what grid can do, see what media queries can do. Set up the rest of the lecture to dive into these concepts.
> * Using live server, render the page found in `0-photo-gallery-grid/` and demonstrate how the number of columns shown changes as the screen is resized. Have fellows follow along with their own copy if they would like.
> * Explain that `display: grid` turns the `ul` into a grid
> * You can mention the 2 grid properties shown in this example: `grid-template-columns`, `grid-auto-rows` but don't spend too much time. The next section you'll be able to go over it more in-depth
> * Remind fellows that they have already seen `gap` in the flexbox lecture.
> * Briefly go over the concept of media queries and ask fellows why these may be useful.
> * Take questions but be mindful of time.

* **CSS Grid** is a `display` type that is useful for making grids (duh)!
* **Media queries** allow us to apply CSS _in response_ to changes to the device's screen size (and other things too!). 
* Media queries are how we implement **responsive web design**, ensuring usability across all devices.

## Part 1 - Grid vs Flexbox

> **Pacing**: 5 minutes (15 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** Compare and contrast grid and flexbox. Understand that grid defines a layout with rows AND columns.
> * Use the diagram below to explain the difference between flexbox and grid. Pose the question to the group, how many rows/columns are in the example pictured above?

* Flexbox is a `display` type that allows us to arrange items in rows OR columns
* Grid is a `display` type allows us to arrange items in rows AND columns
* In a grid, grid items can span across multiple rows and/or columns

**Q: How many rows and columns are there in the photo gallery example from the previous part?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

5 columns and 5 rows

## Part 2 - Grid Template Columns and Fractional Units

> **Pacing**: 15 minutes (30 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** Learn how to define columns using fractional units.
> * Using live server, render the page found in `3-grid-template-columns/`.
> * This demo is all about showing how to define columns using fractional units. If time, you can show how %-based columns will cause an overflow when there is a `gap`. 
> * Have fellows intuit when rows are created automatically and what the default row height will be.
> * Show `grid-auto-rows: 1fr` to achieve equal-height rows.

* Grid containers define their columns and rows
* `grid-template-columns` defines:
  * the number of columns
  * the width of each column
* The `fr` unit (the "fractional unit") is unique to grid. It evenly distributes the grid container's available width to each grid item without overflowing.


```css
.grid-container { 
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* make 4 equal-sized columns */
}
```

![](images/template-columns.png)

**Q: There are 9 elements but only 4 columns. What do you notice happens when the elements overflow? How is the row height determined?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

* If there are more elements than columns, they will flow into a new row that is created automatically.
* By default, row height is determined by the largest row item.
* Use `grid-auto-rows: 1fr;` to make all rows have equal size.

</details><br>

**Q: How would you adjust this to make columns of different sizes? For example, make the middle two columns twice as wide as the outer two.**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

We can make columns of different sizes by adjusting the relative `fr` units. To make the middle columns twice as wide as the outer columns, use `2fr` instead of `1fr`

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 2fr 1fr; /* make 4 equal-sized columns */
```

## Part 3 - Media Queries

> **Pacing**: 10 minutes (40 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** Demonstrate how to create media queries using min-width and max-width
> * Using live server, render the page found in `3-media-queries/`
> * Have fellows look at the code in small groups and play with resizing their screen to see how the styles are applied
> * Have fellows update the breakpoints to match bootstrap's breakpoint sizes.
> * Review flexbox `flex-direction` and have fellows change the flex direction to `row` for Medium devices

* **Media queries** allow us to apply CSS _in response_ to changes to the device's screen size (and other things too!). Media queries are how we implement **responsive web design**, ensuring usability across all devices.

* **Breakpoints** are points at which a responsive web design will shift.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) is one of the most popular CSS frameworks and uses the following breakpoint sizes:


| Breakpoint                         | Dimensions |
|------------------------------------|------------|
| X-Small Devices (portrait phones)  | < 576px    |
| Small Devices (landscape phones)   | ≥ 576px    |
| Medium Devices (tables)            | ≥ 768px    |
| Large Devices (desktops)           | ≥ 992px    |
| X-Large Devices (large desktops)   | ≥ 1200px    |
| XX-Large Devices (larger desktops) | ≥ 1400px    |

* They don't target every specific use case or device, but the ranges provide broad coverage.
* **Challenge**: At `700px` and `900px`, change the number of columns to 2 and then to 3.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

To set the number of grid columns to 2 at 700 pixels, we need to add a second ruleset to the media query.

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {
  .box {
    background: orchid;
  }
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Part 4 - Spanning Rows and Columns

> **Pacing**: 15 minutes (55 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** Learn how to define columns using fractional units.
> * Using live server, render the page found in `4-responsive-grid/`.

* In a grid, the position of grid-items can span multiple rows and/or columns

![A grid with 2 columns and 4 rows. An element on the first row spans both columns. An element on the second row spans only the left column. An element on the third row also only spans the left column. A single element in the right column spans rows 2 and 3. Finally an element in the fourth row spans both columns.](./images/grid-span.png)

**Q: How many rows and columns does this layout have?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

![](./images/grid-span-with-tracks.png)

### Grid Tracks

* **Grid Tracks** are numbered starting at `1` and go between columns and rows.
* Grid track numbers can be used to span grid items across columns and/or rows using `grid-row` and `grid-column`

```css
.grid-item:nth-child(1) {
  grid-row: 1;
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
}
.grid-item:nth-child(4) {
  grid-row: 2;
  grid-column: 2 / 4
}
.grid-item:nth-child(5) {
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
  grid-column: 3
}
```

* To specify the starting row / column for a grid-item, simply provide the grid track number as the value.
* To span across multiple rows/columns, the syntax is `start-row / end-row`

**Challenge: Using media queries and `grid-row`/`grid-column`, produce the grid layout below for screen sizes above `992px`**

![A grid layout with two rows and four columns. The first row has a grid item spanning columns 1 and 2, a grid item in column 3, and a grid item spanning from row 1 to row 2. The second row has a a grid item in column 1, a grid item spanning columns 2 and 3, and the bottom of the grid item in column 3 that spans both rows.](./images/grid-span-challenge.png)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```css
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  }
  .grid-item:nth-child(1) {
    grid-row: 1;
    grid-column: 1 / 3;
  }
  .grid-item:nth-child(4) {
    grid-row: 2;
    grid-column: 2 / 4;
  }
  .grid-item:nth-child(5) {
    grid-row: 1 / 3;
    grid-column: 4;
  }
}
```

## Bonus! - Flexbox Media Query Challenge

Using media queries and the `display: flex` properties, achieve the responsive design below starting with the code found in `5-responsive-flexbox-challenge/`

![](images/flexbox-media-query-challenge.png)

**Q: What do you notice if different about the two layouts?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

* Mobile view: navigation links are in a row and are above the `main`
* Desktop view: navigation links are in a column and are to the side of `main`
