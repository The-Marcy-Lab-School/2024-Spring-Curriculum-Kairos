## Loading JavaScript into our HTML

### The OG Way

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
```

**Q: Why do we put the script at the end of the body?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Because our JavaScript uses the Elements in the body. If those Elements haven't loaded yet, we can't referenced them! We'll get errors like this:

```error
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')
```

</details><br>

**Note**: this still works if we just open the `index.html` file

### DOMContentLoaded

So, **we need to wait for the document to load before executing our JavaScript**. One way to tackle this is through JavaScript:

```js
console.log("hello from index.js");

const main = () => {
  document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Coding is the best';
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```

Here, we attach an event listener to the `document` that **waits for all of the DOM content to load** before invoking our `main` function.

This lets us put the `<script>` in the `<head>` which means **the browser will start loading that file** but won't run it until the DOM is complete.

```html
<head>
  <!-- other meta tags + scripts -->
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Q: Is it still possible for us to have errors in our app?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Yes! If accidentally put some DOM code outside of the safety of our `main` function.

```js
console.log("hello from index.js");

const existingText = document.querySelector('h1').textContent;
// ^ this will throw an error

const main = () => {
  document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Coding is the best';
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```

</details><br>

### Defer

Waiting for `'DOMContentLoaded` works but it still leaves room for errors! An easier solution is to use the `defer` attribute in the `<script>` tag.

```html
<head>
  <!-- other meta tags + scripts -->
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
```

And our JavaScript can skip adding the event listener:

```js
console.log("hello from index.js");

const main = () => {
  document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Coding is the best';
}

main();
```

Now...
* the `index.html` page can start loading the `index.js` file...
* but it won't execute that code until the DOM is done loading

## Dealing with Multiple JavaScript Files

Suppose I wanted to load another JavaScript file. Okay, just add another `<script>`:

```html
<head>
  <!-- other meta tags -->
  <script defer src="./other.js"></script>
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
```

This works but it has some issues. Let's explore why.

### Order Matters & Global Variables

```js
/* other.js */
const test = 'I am a test'; // this is a global variable

/* index.js */
console.log(test); // I can access this global variable over here
```

But if we swap the order of the scripts in HTML, we will get an error.

```html
<head>
  <!-- other meta tags -->
  <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
  <script defer src="./other.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Q: Why will this cause an error?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

It will cause an error because `test` is defined in `other.js` which hasn't been executed yet!

```error
Uncaught ReferenceError: test is not defined
```

</details><br>

So, the order matters. With 2 files this is manageable, just swap them. But when our application has hundreds or even thousands of files, good luck. We need a better solution.

### Importing and Exporting with ESModules

In Node, we could share code by importing and exporting using the **CommonJS** syntax:

<details><summary>See CommonJS Example</summary>

```js
/* other.js */
const test = 'I am a test';

module.exports = test // default export in CommonJS
module.exports = { test } // named export in CommonJS

/* index.js */

const test = require('./other.js'); // default import in CommonJS
const { test } = require('./other.js'); // named import in CommonJS
```

</details><br>

In the browser, we need to use a different syntax called **ESModule** syntax:

```js
/* other.js */
export const test = 'I am a test'; // named export

export default test; // default export

/* index.js */

import test from './other.js'; // default import in ESModule
import { test } from './other.js'; // named import in ESModule
```

### We can't use ESModule with normal scripts

There are two issues with this.

First, we can't use ESModule syntax in normal .js files. We will get this error:

```error
Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

We can easily fix this in our HTML by adding a `type="module"` to our `<script>` (and we can now remove `defer` since modules automaticaly defer)

```html
<head>
  <!-- other meta tags -->
  <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
</head>
```

But we will still get an error called a **Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** error. 

<details><summary>Details about CORS</summary>

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict webpages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page. When you open a file using the `file://` protocol (local file system), it is treated as a different origin compared to the typical `http://` or `https://` origins.

If your web app relies on making requests between different modules or resources and you are testing it by directly opening HTML files using the `file://` protocol in a browser, you may encounter CORS errors. This is because the browser enforces the same-origin policy and prevents cross-origin requests, including those made between different files using the `file://` protocol.

To avoid CORS issues during development, it's recommended to set up a local development server (e.g., using tools like `http-server`, `live-server`, or frameworks like Webpack with devServer). Running your web app through a local server will allow you to simulate a more typical web environment with `http://` or `https://` protocols, which should prevent CORS issues during testing.

([Learn more about CORS here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)).

To get around this, **we need to serve our `html` file from a Server, not from our file system**. This helps the browser see that all of the files are coming from the same origin. 

**Just use Live Server!**

This also plays nice when we deploy using Github Pages (more on that later this week).

## Summary

So, let's recap:

* When loading JavaScript into HTML, we need to wait for the DOM to load.
* Using `type="module"` defers automatically but we can also use `defer` for non-modular code.
* We have to use **ESModule** syntax in the browser:

```js
/* other.js */
export const test = 'I am a test'; // named export
export default test; // default export

/* index.js */

import test from './other.js'; // default import in ESModule
import { test } from './other.js'; // named import in ESModule
```

* When using modules in the browser, we need to serve the `index.html` file using a server
